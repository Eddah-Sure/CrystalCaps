# CrystalCaps
GNN + Capsules for crystalline materials
This paper introduces a novel architecture, Capsule Crystal Graph Networks*, that integrates capsule networks into GNNs to extract node features. By adopting the use capsules to generate multiple embeddings for each atom species, CapsCGNets captures a crystals structural and chemical properties property from different aspects. The use of vector capsules explicitly models part-whole hierarchies between the individual atoms and the crystal in periodic crystalline systems, enabling robust learning of local atomic environments and their interactions. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on a number of prediction tasks on the Materials project data and provide interpretable insights into the learned capsule representations.
